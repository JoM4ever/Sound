#---------------------------------Sound Level Sensor-----------------------
Sound level meter project made by KHANH DO, Feb.2018.

This project uses a Raspberry PI 3 Mode B as a sound sensor. A USB sound card
with microphone and a RJ45 cable are needed as peripheral. The application runs
periodically every second and take record from microphone at a sample rate of
16000Hz. The sound is then calculated into 80 pieces of RMS value and displayed
as bar chart on terminal screen. If communication is enable ( conditional
complication), the sound will be re-calculated into 8 pieces of Fast Level data
and sent out to a PHP server program.
